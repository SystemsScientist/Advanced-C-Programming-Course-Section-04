Section 04: MakeFiles
-------------------------------------------------------------------

	- if you still want to work from the command line,
	  the makefile utility is a tool that you might
	  want to learn how to use

		+ not part of the C language
		
		+ very helpful when developing larger 
		  programs

		+ can help speed your development time

	- this powerful utility allows you to specify a
	  list of files and their dependencies in a
	  special file known as a Makefile

	- the make program automatically recompiles files
	  only when necessary, based on the modification
	  times of a file

	- if make finds that your source (.c) file is 
	  newer than your corresponding object (.o) file,
	  automatically issues the commands to recompile
	  the source file to create a new object file
	
	- you can even specify files that depend on 
	  header file

	- you can specify that a module called datefuncs.o
	  is dependent on its source file datefunc.c as
	  well as the header file date.h

	- if you change anything inside the date.h 
	  header file, the make utility automatically
	  recompiles the datefuncs.c file, based on the
	  fact that the header file is newer than the
	  source file


Example

	SRC = mod1.c mod2.c main.c

	OBJ = mod1.o mod2.o main.o

	PROG = myProgram$(PROG):$(OBJ)
		gcc $(OBJ) -o $(PROG)
	
	$(OBJ):$(SRC)
