Section 04: Using Header Files Effectively
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview

	- include files are great for grouping all your commonly used
	  definitions inside a file

	- you can then simply include the file in any program that needs
	  to use those definitions

	- nowhere is the usefulness of the #include facility greater than
  	  in developing programs that have been divided into separate
	  program modules

	- if more than one programmer is working on developing a particular
	  program, include files provide a means of standardization

		+ each programmer is using the same definitions, which
		  have the same values

		+ each programmer is also spared the time-consuming and
	 	  error-prone task of typing these definitions into each
		  file that must use them

	- by centralizing the definition of common data structures into
	  one or more include files

		+ you eliminate the error that is caused by two modules
		  that use different definitions for the same data
		  structure

		+ if a change has to be made to the definition of a
		  particular data structure, it can be done in one
		  place only - inside the include file
